Treehouse Techdegree Project 8: Using Gulp to Build a Front End Website

Ronald van der Bergh

This project takes starter files provided by Treehouse and uses gulp to build a deployment-ready website. The following criteria are met:

JavaScript files are concatenated and minified.
SCSS files are converted to CSS and minified.
Source map files for JavaScript and CSS are created.
JPEG or PNG files are compressed.

The app outputs to a `dist` folder, ready for deployment.

For extra credit, the app watches for changes to SCSS files when the default `gulp` command is run. Changes to SCSS files will result in the command `gulp styles` to be run and the files are compiled, concatenated, minified, and saved in the `dist` folder. The webpage automatically refreshes and displays the changes in the browser.
